.PP
fl2k output options
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR fl2k[:<dev>]
Open an fl2k device for output.
.TP
\fB\-\-fl2k\-audio\fR <mode>
Audio mode (none, stereo, spdif), default: none
.IP
Each of the FL2K's three output channels can be used for:
.IP
Red: Baseband video / Complex I signal
Green: Complex Q signal / Analogue audio (Left) / Nothing
Blue: Analogue audio (Right) / Digital audio (S/PDIF) / Nothing
.IP
The 0.7v p\-p voltage level of the FL2K is too low to create a correct
composite video signal, it will appear too dark without amplification.
.IP
Digital S/PDIF audio is currently fixed at 16\-bit, 32 kHz. Not all
decoders work at this sample rate.
.IP
Analogue audio is limited to 8\-bits. The LSB is delta\-sigma modulated at
the FL2K sample rate with the lower 8\-bits of the 16\-bit audio and may be
recovered by using a low pass filter of ~16 kHz on the output.
.PP
File output options
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR file:<filename>
Open a file for output. Use \- for stdout.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-type\fR <type>
Set the file data type.
.PP
Supported file types:
.IP
uint8
int8
uint16
int16
int32
float
.IP
The default output is int16. The TV mode will determine if the output
is real or complex.
.IP
If no valid output prefix is provided, file: is assumed.
.PP
NOTE: The number of samples per line is rounded to the nearest integer,
which may result in a slight frame rate error.
.PP
For modes which include audio you also need to ensure the sample rate
is adequate to contain both the video signal and audio subcarriers.
.PP
16MHz works well with PAL modes, and 13.5MHz for NTSC modes.
.PP
20.25MHz is ideal for the D/D2\-MAC modes, but may not work with all hackrfs.
.PP
Teletext
.PP
Teletext is a digital information service transmitted within the VBI lines of
the video signal. Developed in the UK in the 1970s, it was used throughout
much of Europe until the end of analogue TV in the 2010s.
.PP
hacktv supports TTI files. The path can be either a single file or a
directory. All files in the directory will be loaded.
.PP
Raw packet sources are also supported with the raw:<source> path name.
The input is expected to be 42 byte teletext packets. Use \- for stdin.
.PP
Lines 7\-22 and 320\-335 are used, 16 lines per field.
.PP
Teletext support in hacktv is only compatible with 625 line PAL modes.
NTSC and SECAM variations exist and may be supported in the future.
.PP
WSS (Widescreen Signaling)
.PP
WSS provides a method to signal to a TV the intended aspect ratio of
the video. The following modes are supported:
.TP
4:3
= 4:3 video
.TP
14:9\-letterbox
= 14:9 video centred
.TP
14:9\-top
= 14:9 video at top
.TP
16:9\-letterbox
= 16:9 video centred
.TP
16:9\-top
= 16:9 video at top
.TP
16:9+\-letterbox
= >16:9 video centred
.TP
14:9\-window
= 4:3 video with a 14:9 protected window
.TP
16:9
= 16:9 video (Anamorphic)
.TP
auto
= Automatically switch between 4:3 and 16:9 modes.
.PP
Currently only supported in 625 line modes. A 525 line variant exists and
may be supported in future.
.PP
Videocrypt I
.PP
A video scrambling system used by the Sky TV analogue satellite service in
the UK in the 1990s. Each line of the image is cut at a point determined by
a pseudorandom number generator, then the two parts are swapped.
.PP
hacktv supports the following modes:
.TP
free
= Free\-access, no subscription card is required to decode.
.IP
conditional = A valid Sky card is required to decode. Sample data from MTV.
.PP
Videocrypt is only compatible with 625 line PAL modes. This version
works best when used with samples rates at multiples of 14MHz.
.PP
Videocrypt II
.PP
A variation of Videocrypt I used throughout Europe. The scrambling method is
identical to VC1, but has a higher VBI data rate.
.PP
hacktv supports the following modes:
.TP
free
= Free\-access, no subscription card is required to decode.
.PP
Both VC1 and VC2 cannot be used together except if both are in free\-access mode.
.PP
Videocrypt S
.PP
A variation of Videocrypt II used on the short lived BBC Select service. This
mode uses line\-shuffling rather than line cut\-and\-rotate.
.PP
hacktv supports the following modes:
.TP
free
= Free\-access, no subscription card is required to decode.
.IP
conditional = A valid BBC Select card is required to decode. (Does not work yet)
.PP
Audio inversion is not yet supported.
.PP
Nagravision Syster
.PP
Another video scrambling system used in the 1990s in Europe. The video lines
are vertically shuffled within a field.
.PP
Syster is only compatible with 625 line PAL modes and does not currently work
with most hardware.
.PP
Some decoders will invert the audio around 12.8 kHz. For these devices you need
to use the \fB\-\-systeraudio\fR option.
.PP
Eurocrypt
.PP
Conditional access (CA) system used by D/D2MAC services, M and S2 versions are
supported.
.PP
hacktv supports the following modes:
.TP
filmnet
= (M) A valid FilmNet card is required to decode.
.TP
tv1000
= (M) A valid Viasat card is required to decode.
.TP
ctv
= (M) A valid CTV card is required to decode.
.TP
ctvs
= (S) A valid CTV card is required to decode.
.TP
tvplus
= (M) A valid TV Plus (Netherlands) card is required to decode.
.TP
tvs
= (S) A valid TVS (Denmark) card is required to decode.
.TP
rdv
= (S) A valid RDV card is required to decode.
.TP
nrk
= (S) A valid NRK card is required to decode.
.PP
MultiMac style cards can also be used.
